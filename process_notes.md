It seemed really promising to find the process manual from pavillion_35 (artists collective based in Vienna)[1], but upon closer inspection, some of the details seemed overcomplicated and unnecessary.

To be fair, it is meant to be an accessible process, using ingredients that can be "easily found", ie. Marmite, beef boullion. However, in my current country, Marmite is absolutely scarce as well as beef products, to a lesser extent.  In terms of accessibility (to raw materials and equipment), this obviously varies with locale.

Instead of the suggested SAPY (sugar, agar, peptone, yeast extract) solution, I went with LBA (lysogeny broth, agar). We're just growing yeast, right???

I forgot to bring the baker's yeast with me to the lab, so while autoclaving a new mixture of LBA + charcoal (2g/L), I used already-prepared plates of LBA (which don't have enough charcoal to see much) and LBA with antibiotics [2]. I flooded the plates with a solution of baker's yeast and filter-sterilised water (.4g/50ml).

I didn't follow the instructed UV set-up too closely. My specs are UV LED 1W, 395nm, 3.0-3.4V, 300mA, 10-15Lm; this is in a series of 3 [3]. I will wait to see these results, before I make changes.

I used some leaves as the "image", because I'm waiting for printable transparencies to arrive. Those are rather difficult to find around here as well.

3 plates exposed and left in ambient conditions; ~29'C, diffused light. <br>
A: LB; UV-exposed 24hrs; 41hrs since. <br>
B: LB + characoal; UV-exposed 26hrs; 17hrs since <br>
C: LB + antibiotic; UV-exposed 26hrs; 17hrs since <br>

A: white spots appearing within the white haze (exposed parts). <br>
B: can't really see what has been exposed and what hasn't, because the UV light slipped during exposure. there's also condensation inside the lid, so this isn't too promising. <br>
C: clear exposed image, no other change so far. <br>

Again, these tests are priortised for process-determination, as preparations thus far are not adapted for anything visually-appealing. Based on assumptions, of course.
